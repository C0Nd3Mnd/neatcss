    <p>A minimalist, long lasting, HTML template.<p>
    
    <p>Neat.html is a minimalist HTML template for writing.</p>

    <p>I like my web pages neat. Neat.html is a minimalist html and css layout. It's inspired by other minimalist sites like <a href="100r.co">Hundred Rabits</a>.</p>
 
    <h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>

    <p>Neat.html follows these rules.</p>

    <p>Small</p>

    <p>Neat was designed to be very small.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Simple HTML and CSS only</li>
        <li>Symantec</li>
        <li>Small</li>
        <li>Accessable</li>
        <li>Long lasting</li>
        <li>Free</li>
        <li>Responsive</li>
        <li>Low Energy and Fast</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Small</h3>

    <p>Neat was designed to be small.</p>

    <h3>Low Energy and Fast</h3>

    <p>Designed to be fast, even on the slowest connections. Consuming very little memory, bandwidth, and energy on both the server and the client.</p>

    <h3>Long Lasting</h3>

    <p>Technology changes fast. The technology that's stuck around the longest is html.</p>

    <h2 id="start">Getting Started</h2>

    <p>Rename neat.html to index.html and open it in your favorite text editor.</p>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

    <p>Neat.html was designed for.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Blogs</li>
        <li>Journals</li>
        <li>Technical sites</li>
        <li>Documentation</li>
        <li>Books</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Neat.html was designed for.</p>

    <h2 id="decisions">Design Decisions</h2>

    <p>As with anything, you've got to make decisions on the design of Neat.html. Here are some of the decisions I've made and the rational for them.</p>

    <h3>Max Width</h3>

    <p>The body max-width is 800px by default. I find a thinner column of text to be more readable on very large monitors. This is simple to change by editing the <em>max-width</em> of the <em>body</em> element in <em>neat.css</em>.</p>

    <h3>Left Aligned</h3>

    <p>The body is left aligned. I tried center aligned first, but I just wasn't feeling it. I visited some of my favorite sites on the web and found that most of them where left aligned. So, I went with that.</p>
