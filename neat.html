    <h2 id="about">About</h2>

    <img src="https://neat.joeldare.com/images/neat-screenshot.png" style="border: 3px solid #404040">
    
    <p>Neat is a simple HTML template. It's tiny, opinionated, and made to last. It's created by Joel Dare and heavily inspired by other minimalist sites like <a href="100r.co">Hundred Rabits</a> and dozens of similar blogs.</p>

    <p>Neat is currently 7k (yes kilobytes) including this documentation. It adds only about 1k of overhead to whatever you create with it. And that's when it's not minified or compressed.</p>

    <p>"That's pretty neat!"</p>


    <h2 id="start">Getting Started</h2>

    <p>Copy neat.html to index.html and edit it in your favorite text editor.</p>

    <h2 id="uses">Uses</h2>

    <p>Neat.html was designed for.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Blogs</li>
        <li>Journals</li>
        <li>Technical sites</li>
        <li>Documentation</li>
        <li>Books</li>
        <li>Simple shops</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="customizing">Customizing</h2>

    <p>It's easy to customize Neat. The best way is to create a new <em>custom.css</em> file and then add the following line to the head of your page.</p>

    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="custom.css"&gt;</pre>
        
    <p>That will give you the option of updating <em>neat.css</em> without losing any of your personalizations.</p>


    <h2 id="decisions">Design Decisions</h2>

    <p>Neat is opinionated and here are some of the decisions I've made and the rational for each of them.</p>

    <h3>Small</h3>

    <p>Neat was designed to be tiny. The modern web is out of crontrol and Neat is a small stand against that trend. A side-effect of being small is that it's also fast.</p>

    <h3>Low Energy</h3>

    <p>Because it's small and fast it also consumes less resources. It should work well even on the slowest connections. Consuming less energy on both the client and the server side.</p>

    <h3>Long Lasting</h3>

    <p>The web is relatively young and technology changes fast but one of the technologies that has lasted as long as the Internet is HTML. There are lots of other interesting formats such as Text, Markdown, or even PDF, but I think plain HTML has a good chance of working well into the future.</p>

    <h3>Not Minified</h3>

    <p>I'm not a fan of minified code. It requires the complexity of a transpiler and it makes the site less open for inspection, learning, accessability, and archive. The size trade-off is only worth it in rare cases.</p> 

    <h3>Max Width</h3>

    <p>The body <em>max-width</em> is 800px by default. I find a thinner column of text to be more readable on very large monitors. This is simple to change by editing the <em>max-width</em> of the <em>body</em> element in your own <em>custom.css</em> file.</p>

    <h3>Left Aligned</h3>

    <p>The body is left aligned. I tried center aligned first, but I just wasn't feeling it. I visited some of my favorite sites on the web and found that most of them where left aligned. So, I went with that.</p>

    <h3>Images</h3>

    <p>Images are 100% width by default. This works best with images that are wide and short. You can set manual sizes on individual images as it suits you or change the image width in your <em>custom.css</em> if you typically use a different aspect ratio.</p>

    <h3>Left Gutter</h3>

    <p>The left gutter is wider at larger sizes, giving the page a little more breathing room at desktop sizes.</p> 

    <h3>Buttons are Links</h3>

    <p>I try to use symantic web tags whenever possible. Buttons are a unique case where most people want a button to link somewhere, but the button tag doesn't currently support the href attribute. So, buttons are <em>anchor</em> tags with a <em>class</em> of <em>button</em>. You can also throw a <em>div</em> with a <em>center</em> class around it to make it centered. I don't love this solution and I'm open to suggestions.</p>

    <pre>&lt;a class="button" href="#"&gt;Button&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

    <div class="center">
        <a href="#about" class="button">Download</a>
    </div>

    <h3>No Header</h3>

    <p>Originally, I started to build a header with navigation links in it, but the css code piled up and it didn't feel minimalist to me. Those links are also a distraction on whatever message your page is trying to tell. In my research I found lots of examples of minimalist sites without top navigation and only a link back to the home page. As a result, there is no header and no navigation, other than the link back to the home page.</p>
